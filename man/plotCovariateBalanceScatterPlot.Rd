\usage{
plotCovariateBalanceScatterPlot(
  balance,
  absolute = TRUE,
  threshold = 0,
  alpha = NULL,
  title = "Standardized difference of mean",
  fileName = NULL,
  beforeLabel = "Before matching",
  afterLabel = "After matching",
  showCovariateCountLabel = FALSE,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{balance}{A data frame created by the \code{computeCovariateBalance} function.}

\item{absolute}{Should the absolute value of the difference be used?}

\item{threshold}{Show a threshold value for after matching standardized difference.}

\item{alpha}{The family-wise alpha for testing whether the absolute value of the standardized
difference of means is greater than the threshold. If provided, any covariates
significantly (after Bonferroni correction) exceeding the threshold will be
highlighted in the plot.}

\item{title}{The main title for the plot.}

\item{fileName}{Name of the file where the plot should be saved, for example 'plot.png'. See the
function \code{ggsave} in the ggplot2 package for supported file formats.}

\item{beforeLabel}{Label for the x-axis.}

\item{afterLabel}{Label for the y-axis.}

\item{showCovariateCountLabel}{Show a label with the number of covariates included in the plot?}

\item{showMaxLabel}{Show a label with the maximum absolute standardized difference after matching/stratification?}
}
\value{
A ggplot object. Use the \link[ggplot2:ggsave]{ggplot2::ggsave} function to save to file in a different
format.
}
\description{
Create a scatterplot of the covariate balance, showing all variables with balance before and after
matching on the x and y axis respectively. Requires running \code{computeCovariateBalance} first.
