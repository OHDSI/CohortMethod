\arguments{
\item{connectionDetails}{An R object of type \code{connectionDetails} created using the
\code{\link[DatabaseConnector:createConnectionDetails]{DatabaseConnector::createConnectionDetails()}} function.}

\item{cdmDatabaseSchema}{The name of the database schema that contains the OMOP CDM
instance. Requires read permissions to this database. On SQL
Server, this should specify both the database and the schema,
so for example 'cdm_instance.dbo'.}

\item{tempEmulationSchema}{Some database platforms like Oracle and Impala do not truly support temp tables. To
emulate temp tables, provide a schema with write privileges where temp tables
can be created.}

\item{exposureDatabaseSchema}{The name of the database schema that is the location where the
exposure data used to define the exposure cohorts is
available. If exposureTable = DRUG_ERA, exposureDatabaseSchema
is not used by assumed to be cdmSchema.  Requires read
permissions to this database.}

\item{exposureTable}{The tablename that contains the exposure cohorts.  If
exposureTable <> DRUG_ERA, then expectation is exposureTable
has format of COHORT table: COHORT_DEFINITION_ID, SUBJECT_ID,
COHORT_START_DATE, COHORT_END_DATE.}

\item{outcomeDatabaseSchema}{The name of the database schema that is the location where the
data used to define the outcome cohorts is available. If
exposureTable = CONDITION_ERA, exposureDatabaseSchema is not
used by assumed to be cdmSchema.  Requires read permissions to
this database.}

\item{outcomeTable}{The tablename that contains the outcome cohorts.  If
outcomeTable <> CONDITION_OCCURRENCE, then expectation is
outcomeTable has format of COHORT table: COHORT_DEFINITION_ID,
SUBJECT_ID, COHORT_START_DATE, COHORT_END_DATE.}

\item{cdmVersion}{Define the OMOP CDM version used: currently support "4" and
"5".}

\item{outputFolder}{Name of the folder where all the outputs will written to.}

\item{cmAnalysisList}{A list of objects of type \code{cmAnalysis} as created using
the `\link{createCmAnalysis} function.}

\item{targetComparatorOutcomesList}{A list of objects of type \code{targetComparatorOutcomes} as
created using the \link{createTargetComparatorOutcomes}
function.}

\item{refitPsForEveryOutcome}{Should the propensity model be fitted for every outcome (i.e.
after people who already had the outcome are removed)? If
false, a single propensity model will be fitted, and people
who had the outcome previously will be removed afterwards.}

\item{refitPsForEveryStudyPopulation}{Should the propensity model be fitted for every study population
definition? If false, a single propensity model will be fitted,
and the study population criteria will be applied afterwards.}

\item{prefilterCovariates}{If TRUE, and some outcome models require filtering covariates
by concept ID (e.g. because \code{includeCovariateIds} or
\code{interactionCovariateIds} is specified), this filtering
will be done once for all outcome models that need it. This
can greatly speed up the analyses if multiple outcome models
require the same filtering.}

\item{getDbCohortMethodDataThreads}{The number of parallel threads to use for building the
cohortMethod data objects.}

\item{createPsThreads}{The number of parallel threads to use for fitting the
propensity models.}

\item{psCvThreads}{The number of parallel threads to use for the cross-
validation when estimating the hyperparameter for the
propensity model. Note that the total number of CV threads at
one time could be \code{createPsThreads * psCvThreads}.}

\item{createStudyPopThreads}{The number of parallel threads to use for creating the study
population.}

\item{trimMatchStratifyThreads}{The number of parallel threads to use for trimming, matching
and stratifying.}

\item{prefilterCovariatesThreads}{The number of parallel threads to use for prefiltering covariates.}

\item{fitOutcomeModelThreads}{The number of parallel threads to use for fitting the outcome
models.}

\item{outcomeCvThreads}{The number of parallel threads to use for the cross-
validation when estimating the hyperparameter for the outcome
model. Note that the total number of CV threads at one time
could be \code{fitOutcomeModelThreads * outcomeCvThreads}.}

\item{outcomeIdsOfInterest}{If provided, creation of non-essential files will be skipped
for all other outcome IDs. This could be helpful to speed up
analyses with many controls.}

\item{analysesToExclude}{Analyses to exclude. See the Analyses to Exclude section for details.}
}
\value{
A tibble describing for each target-comparator-outcome-analysisId combination where the intermediary and
outcome model files can be found, relative to the \code{outputFolder}.

\description{
Run a list of analyses
}
\details{
Run a list of analyses for the target-comparator-outcomes of interest. This function will run all
specified analyses against all hypotheses of interest, meaning that the total number of outcome
models is \code{length(cmAnalysisList) * length(targetComparatorOutcomesList)} (if all analyses specify an
outcome model should be fitted). When you provide several analyses it will determine whether any of
the analyses have anything in common, and will take advantage of this fact. For example, if we
specify several analyses that only differ in the way the outcome model is fitted, then this
function will extract the data and fit the propensity model only once, and re-use this in all the
analysis.
\subsection{Analyses to Exclude}{

Normally, \code{runCmAnalyses} will run all combinations of target-comparator-outcome-analyses settings.
However, sometimes we may not need all those combinations. Using the \code{analysesToExclude} argument,
we can remove certain items from the full matrix. This argument should be a data frame with at least
one of the following columns:
\itemize{
\item targetId
\item comparatorId
\item outcomeId
\item analysisId
}

This data frame will be joined to the outcome model reference table before executing, and matching rows
will be removed. For example, if one specifies only one target ID and analysis ID, then any analyses with
that target and that analysis ID will be skipped.
