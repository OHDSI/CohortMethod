\arguments{
\item{firstExposureOnly}{Should only the first exposure per subject be included?}

\item{restrictToCommonPeriod}{Restrict the analysis to the period when both exposures are
observed?}

\item{washoutPeriod}{The minimum required continuous observation time prior to
index date for a person to be included in the cohort.}

\item{removeDuplicateSubjects}{Remove subjects that are in both the target and comparator
cohort? See details for allowed values.}

\item{removeSubjectsWithPriorOutcome}{Remove subjects that have the outcome prior to the risk
window start?}

\item{priorOutcomeLookback}{How many days should we look back when identifying prior
outcomes?}

\item{minDaysAtRisk}{The minimum required number of days at risk. Risk windows
with fewer days than this number are removed from the
analysis.}

\item{maxDaysAtRisk}{The maximum allowed number of days at risk. Risk windows
that are longer will be truncated to this number of days.}

\item{riskWindowStart}{The start of the risk window (in days) relative to the
startAnchor.}

\item{addExposureDaysToStart}{DEPRECATED: Add the length of exposure the start of the risk
window? Use startAnchor instead.}

\item{startAnchor}{The anchor point for the start of the risk window. Can be
"cohort start" or "cohort end".}

\item{riskWindowEnd}{The end of the risk window (in days) relative to the
endAnchor.}

\item{addExposureDaysToEnd}{DEPRECATED: Add the length of exposure the risk window? Use
endAnchor instead.}

\item{endAnchor}{The anchor point for the end of the risk window. Can be
"cohort start" or "cohort end".}

\item{censorAtNewRiskWindow}{If a subject is in multiple cohorts, should time-at-risk be
censored when the new time-at-risk starts to prevent
overlap?}
