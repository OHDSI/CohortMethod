\title{Compute covariate balance before and after matching and trimming}
\usage{
computeCovariateBalance(population, cohortMethodData)
}
\arguments{
\item{population}{A data frame containing the people that are remaining after matching
and/or trimming.}

\item{cohortMethodData}{An object of type \code{cohortMethodData} as generated using
\code{getDbCohortMethodData}.}
}
\value{
Returns a date frame describing the covariate balance before and after matching/trimming.
}
\description{
For every covariate, prevalence in treatment and comparator groups before and after
matching/trimming are computed. When variable ratio matching was used the balance score will be
corrected according the method described in Austin et al (2008).
}
\details{
The population data frame should have at least the following columns: \tabular{lll}{ \verb{rowId}
\tab(integer) \tab A unique identifier for each row (e.g. the person ID) \cr \verb{treatment}
\tab(integer) \tab Column indicating whether the person is in the treated (1) or comparator (0)\cr
\tab \tab group \cr }
