\usage{
plotKaplanMeier(population, censorMarks = FALSE, confidenceIntervals = TRUE,
  includeZero = FALSE, dataTable = TRUE, dataCutoff = 0.9,
  treatmentLabel = "Treated", comparatorLabel = "Comparator", title,
  fileName = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{population}{A population object generated by \code{createStudyPopulation},
potentially filtered by other functions.}

\item{censorMarks}{Whether or not to include censor marks in the plot.}

\item{confidenceIntervals}{Plot 95 percent confidence intervals? Default is TRUE, as recommended by Pocock et al.}

\item{includeZero}{Should the y axis include zero, or only go down to the lowest observed
survival? The default is FALSE, as recommended by Pocock et al.}

\item{dataTable}{Should the numbers at risk be shown in a table? Default is TRUE, as recommended by Pocock et al.}

\item{dataCutoff}{Fraction of the data (number censored) after which the graph will not
be shown. The default is 90 percent as recommended by Pocock et al.}

\item{treatmentLabel}{A label to us for the treated cohort.}

\item{comparatorLabel}{A label to us for the comparator cohort.}

\item{title}{The main title of the plot.}

\item{fileName}{Name of the file where the plot should be saved, for example
'plot.png'. See the function \code{ggsave} in the ggplot2 package for
supported file formats.}
}
\value{
A ggplot object. Use the \code{\link[ggplot2]{ggsave}} function to save to file in a different
format.
}
