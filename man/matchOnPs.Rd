\title{Match persons by propensity score}
\usage{
matchOnPs(population, caliper = 0.2,
  caliperScale = "standardized logit", maxRatio = 1,
  stratificationColumns = c())
}
\arguments{
\item{population}{A data frame with the three columns described below.}

\item{caliper}{The caliper for matching. A caliper is the distance which is
acceptable for any match. Observations which are outside of the
caliper are dropped. A caliper of 0 means no caliper is used.}

\item{caliperScale}{The scale on which the caliper is defined. Three scales are supported:
\cr\code{caliperScale = 'propensity score'}, \code{caliperScale =
'standardized'}, or \cr\code{caliperScale = 'standardized logit'}.
On the standardized scale, the caliper is interpreted in standard
deviations of the propensity score distribution. 'standardized logit'
is similar, except that the propensity score is transformed to the logit
scale because the PS is more likely to be normally distributed on that scale
(Austin, 2011).}

\item{maxRatio}{The maximum number of persons int the comparator arm to be matched to
each person in the treatment arm. A maxRatio of 0 means no maximum:
all comparators will be assigned to a target person.}

\item{stratificationColumns}{Names or numbers of one or more columns in the \code{data} data.frame
on which subjects should be stratified prior to matching. No persons
will be matched with persons outside of the strata identified by the
values in these columns.}
}
\value{
Returns a date frame with the same columns as the input data plus one extra column: stratumId. Any
rows that could not be matched are removed
}
\description{
\code{matchOnPs} uses the provided propensity scores to match target to comparator persons.
}
\details{
The data frame should have at least the following three columns: \tabular{lll}{ \verb{rowId}
\tab(numeric) \tab A unique identifier for each row (e.g. the person ID) \cr \verb{treatment}
\tab(integer) \tab Column indicating whether the person is in the target (1) or comparator\cr \tab
\tab (0) group \cr \verb{propensityScore} \tab(numeric) \tab Propensity score \cr } This function
implements the greedy variable-ratio matching algorithm described in Rassen et al (2012).

The default caliper (0.2 on the standardized logit scale) is the one recommended by Austin (2011).

propensityScore <- c(0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.4, 1)

data <- data.frame(rowId = rowId,
                   treatment = treatment,
                   propensityScore = propensityScore,
                   age_group = age_group)
result <- matchOnPs(data, caliper = 0, maxRatio = 1, stratificationColumns = "age_group")
