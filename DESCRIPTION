Description: Functions for performing new-user cohort studies
	in an observational database in the OMOP Common Data Model. Can extract the
	necessary data from a database and use a large set of covariates for both the 
	propensity and outcome model, including for example all drugs, diagnoses, procedures, 
	as well as age, comorbidity indexes, etc. Large scale regularized regression is used to 
	fit the propensity and outcome models. Functions are included for trimming, stratifying, 
	(variable and fixed ratio) matching and weighting by propensity scores, as well as 
	diagnostic functions, such as propensity score distribution plots and plots showing 
	covariate balance before and after matching and/or trimming. Supported outcome models 
	are (conditional) logistic regression, (conditional) Poisson regression, and 
	(stratified) Cox regression. Also included are Kaplan-Meier plots that can adjust for 
	the stratification or matching.
